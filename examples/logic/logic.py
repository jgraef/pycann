# Example: Logic
#
# This examples demonstrates the use of neural networks as logic gates.
# There are pycann files for OR, AND and XOR gates.
# The program loads and tests them.
# The neural networks are also saved in the pycann embedded format. There is
# an examples program for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT to these networks with it.
